## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical avocado price data in the US to uncover trends and predict future prices using machine learning. The dataset was taken from Kaggle and contains pricing and volume information for avocados sold in various regions.

ðŸ§  Objectives
1.Understand how avocado prices have changed over time
2.Visualize price trends and seasonal patterns
3.Use Linear Regression to predict avocado prices based on date
4.Plot and compare actual vs predicted prices

ðŸ“Š Insights from Data
- The average price of avocados shows clear seasonal variation. Prices are lowest in February and highest in September and October, suggesting that supply-demand fluctuations significantly affect pricing across the year.
