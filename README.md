## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical avocado price data in the US to uncover trends and predict future prices using machine learning. The dataset was taken from Kaggle and contains pricing and volume information for avocados sold in various regions.

ðŸ§  Objectives
1.Understand how avocado prices have changed over time
2.Visualize price trends and seasonal patterns
3.Use Linear Regression to predict avocado prices based on date
4.Plot and compare actual vs predicted prices

ðŸ“Š Insights from Data
-Seasonality: Prices tend to spike during specific months every year (possibly around festivals or low-supply seasons)

-Downward Trend: Overall average price decreased over the years

-Demand-Supply Impact: Price spikes may indicate limited supply or high demand periods

ðŸ’» Tech Stack
-Python

-Pandas

-Matplotlib

-scikit-learn

- Line plot of price trend over time
